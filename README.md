# yabibf: Yet Another BIBliography Formatter

This package was born out of a need to convert BibTeX bibliographies into
formatted HTML entries.  It combines bibtexparser and citeproc-py with some
regex tampering.  In other words, it's a duct-taped monstrosity.  I probably
would've been better off creating a customized pybtex formatter instead, yet
here we are.

Use at your own risk.
