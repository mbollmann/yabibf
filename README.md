# yabibf: Yet Another BIBliography Formatter

This package was born out of a need to convert BibTeX bibliographies into
formatted HTML entries.  It combines bibtexparser and citeproc-py with some
simple and potentially error-prone string replacement.  In other words, it's a
duct-taped monstrosity.  I probably would've been better off doing this in
another programming language with better libraries, yet here we are.

Use at your own risk.
